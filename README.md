# Description
RoPad is an open-source, small, lightweight and flexible notepad-based application I made for fun. This project is being made by one person but feel free to contribute by sharing your custom build or help by finishing the uncomplete core features of RoPad.
# Features
* **Tabs (Complete)** - Edit many files in one single window as you want to, or you could even edit 100 files!
* **Editing the style of the app (Uncomplete)** - Edit the entire appearence of the app to whatever extent you want in the easiest way possible!
* **Printing it (Uncomplete)** - You are able to print the page out in a simpliest way possible
